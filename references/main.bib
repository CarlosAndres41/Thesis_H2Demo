  abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.},

  abstract   = {As the balance of system cost of photovoltaic (PV) installations governs the competitiveness of PV device market, next-generation solar cells desire substantially enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The single-junction perovskite and Si solar cells have demonstrated PCEs beyond 26\% and 25\%, respectively. The tandem configuration has crossed the threshold posed by the shockley queisser limit by demonstrating the 33.9\% PCE. However, the unresolved issues in the perovskite community from a stability perspective pose challenges for realizing highly efficient and stable perovskite--Si tandem solar cells (TSCs). This review highlights the current status of perovskite--Si TSC from a stability perspective besides elucidating the degradation mechanisms at the perovskite--Si at the cell and module level. A highly efficient perovskite--Si TSC needs optimization keeping view the specific requirements for tandem configuration like strain, current matching, and bandgap optimization between the top perovskite and bottom Si subcell. Various stressors affecting the efficiency of the perovskite--Si module, namely, reverse bias and hot spot formation, and delamination, highlight valuable insight to develop future strategies for the perovskite--Si TSC. Stability regimes for the single-junction perovskite solar cell can provide the essential stepping stone but, modified stability regimes are inevitable.},

We outline the physical processes occurring during the life cycle of a bubble, summarize techniques used to characterize gas evolution phenomena in situ and in practical device environments, and discuss ways that electrodes can be tailored to facilitate gas removal at high current densities. Lastly, we review efforts to model the behavior of individual gas bubbles and multiphase flows produced at gas-evolving electrodes.

  abstract   = {The global shift toward sustainable energy solutions emphasises the urgent need to harness renewable sources for green hydrogen production, presenting a critical opportunity in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Despite its potential, integrating renewable energy with electrolysis to produce green hydrogen faces significant technological and economic challenges, particularly in achieving high efficiency and cost-effectiveness at scale. This review systematically examines the latest advancements in electrolysis technologies---alkaline, proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC), and solid oxide---and explores innovative grid integration and energy storage solutions that enhance the viability of green hydrogen. The study reveals enhanced performance metrics in electrolysis processes and identifies critical factors that influence the operational efficiency and sustainability of green hydrogen production. Key findings demonstrate the potential for substantial reductions in the cost and energy requirements of hydrogen production by optimising electrolyser design and operation. The insights from this research provide a foundational strategy for scaling up green hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier, contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance toward carbon neutrality. The integration of these technologies could revolutionise energy systems worldwide, aligning with policy frameworks and market dynamics to foster broader adoption of green hydrogen.},

  abstract = {This review presents the current status of PEM fuel cell \& electrolysis cell technologies, along with the H               2               infrastructure, describes their similarities \& differences in structures, materials, and fundamentals, and outlines challenges/opportunities.                        ,                             Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells or PEMFCs and PEM electrolysis cells or PEMECs are two closely related electrochemical devices having a similar structure: a PEM with catalyst layers (CLs) coated on its surfaces, flow fields, and bipolar plates (BPs). Both systems work at low temperatures (               e.g.               {$\sim$}60--80 {$^\circ$}C) and can operate free of CO               2               emissions. The PEMFC efficiency can reach as high as 65\% with water as the only byproduct when using hydrogen as the fuel. PEMFCs have been considered for stationary, transportation, and portable applications. Several PEMFC products are commercially available, including back-up power and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). As of May 2021, over 10\,000 FCEVs were sold or leased in the U.S. and 48 fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) currently operate in California. More than 3520 FCEVs and 22 FCEBs were sold or leased in Japan up to 2020 and China has more than 6000 FCEVs. The cost and the lack of a hydrogen infrastructure are the two main barriers to the worldwide deployment of PEMFCs. Currently, a PEMFC stack costs about \$75 per kW at high volume production and its CLs account for over 40\% of the overall cost due to the employment of precious platinum-group metals (PGMs) as catalysts. For FCEVs to be competitive cost-wise, the ultimate goal is \$30 per kW for light-duty FCEVs and \$60 per kW for heavy-duty FCEVs. Another challenge that prevents FCEVs from widespread application is that only a few hundred hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are available in the world. To help overcome this challenge, Japan has set a target of building 320 stations by 2025 and 900 by 2030. Europe has a roadmap of achieving 1500 stations by 2025. China has over 40 HRSs and has been reported to have invested \$17 billion dollars in hydrogen infrastructure. PEMECs operate in the reverse process of PEMFCs,               i.e.               hydrogen production through water splitting using electrical energy, and provide a promising source of renewable hydrogen to supply the fueling infrastructure. They have been successfully commercialized with power varying from a few kW to multiple MW and efficiency around 60--80\%. As of 2019, over 14 MW of PEMECs have been installed or are underway across the U.S. The cost of producing hydrogen               via               PEMECs, which is currently at about \$4--6 per kg, has been a limiting factor that prevents large-scale deployment and application. The U.S. DOE has recently set a target to achieve \$1 per kg within one decade through the Hydrogen Shot initiative. The objectives of this review are three-fold: (1) to present the current status of PEMFC and PEMEC technologies and their ongoing development, along with the hydrogen infrastructure, (2) to describe the similarities and differences in PEMFC and PEMEC structures, materials, and fundamentals, and (3) to outline the major challenges and opportunities in the widespread deployment of PEMFCs and PEMECs and hydrogen infrastructure development.},

To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced electrocatalysts to improve electrolytic efficiency and reduce the cost of PEM electrolyser. In this review, we firstly compare the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and PEM water electrolysis and highlight the advantages of PEM water electrolysis. Furthermore, we summarize the recent progress in PEM water electrolysis including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in the acidic electrolyte. We also introduce other PEM cell components (including membrane electrode assembly, current collector, and bipolar plate). Finally, the current challenges and an outlook for the future development of PEM water electrolysis technology for application in future hydrogen production are provided.},
